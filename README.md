Solid-three is a port of [React-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
originally created by [Nikhil Saraf](https://github.com/nksaraf).
It allows you to declaratively construct a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
scene, with reactive primitives, just as you would construct a DOM tree in SolidJS.

> **Note** This library has just been published to NPM from this repo.
