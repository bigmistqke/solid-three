Solid-three is a port of [React-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
originally created by [Nikhil Saraf](https://github.com/nksaraf).
It allows you to declaratively construct a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
scene, with reactive primitives, just as you would construct a DOM tree in SolidJS.

> **Note** This library has not been published to NPM from this repo yet;
> stay tuned.

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i solid-three
# or
yarn add solid-three
# or
pnpm add solid-three
```

Use it:

```tsx
import { Canvas } from 'solid-three'
```

Sample application coming soon!
